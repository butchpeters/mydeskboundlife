My name is Brian, but I'm known to most of my colleagues as Butch. I currently work at [CDK Global, Inc.](http://www.cdkglobal.com) as a Software Engineer.

In the summer of 2013, I decided that I was done being the stereotypical overweight, unhealthy computer nerd. My wife, Cassie, and I both stopped eating meat and limited our use of other animal products. We instead focused on a nutrient rich plant-based diet and almost immediately noticed a difference in how we looked and felt.

I dedicate this blog to my son, Bryce, born in 2015. If Cassie and I had not improved our lifestyle, I strongly believe he would have never existed.
